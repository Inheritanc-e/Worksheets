```
_____________________________________________________________________
```

### Answers

1. The challenge is that English present tense can be expressed in subtly different ways, making it difficult to choose the correct translation.

2. Three different ways to translate the sentence are: "The child has an illness", "The child does have an illness", and "The child is having an illness".

3. Considering the context is important because English present tense is more complicated than German, and the correct translation depends on the specific context of the sentence.

4. The addition of time information affects the translation of the verb tense in English, as it may require the use of a different verb tense, such as future or present-perfect.

5. "Ab morgen" indicates that the action will start tomorrow, and it affects the translation by requiring the use of the English future tense.

6. The correct translation is "The child has a fever".

7. English past tense is never a translation option for German present tense because German present tense never conveys a past, completed event.

8. The difference is that "The child has an illness" is a more general statement, while "The child is having an illness" implies a more specific, temporary condition.

9. An example is "Das Kind hat seit gestern Fieber", which requires the use of the English present-perfect tense in translation.

10. The key is to consider the additional time information, such as "ab morgen" or "seit gestern", which helps decide the appropriate translation.
